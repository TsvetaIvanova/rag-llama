All statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding ou\\nfuture results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\\n\"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections abou\\nfuture events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward\\nlooking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a ver\\ncompetitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent t\\nwhich any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, th\\nfuture events and trends discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\\nWe undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not t\\nplace undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\\nUnless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms \"Meta,\" \"company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" in this document refer to Meta Platforms, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate, it\\nsubsidiaries. The term \"Family\" refers to our Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp products. For references to accessing Meta\\'s products on the \"web\" or via a \"website,\" such terms refer to accessing suc\\nproducts on personal computers. For references to accessing Meta\\'s products on \"mobile,\" such term refers to accessing such products via a mobile application or via a mobile-optimized version of our websites such a\\nm.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet.\\nTable of Contents\\nLIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA\\nThe numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP), monthly active peopl\\n(MAP), and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\\nof products) during the applicable period of measurement. We have historically reported the numbers of our daily active users (DAUs), monthly active users (MAUs), and average revenue per user (ARPU) (collectively\\nour \"Facebook metrics\") based on user activity only on Facebook and Messenger and not on our other products. We believe our Family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people ar\\nusing more than one of our products. As a result, over time we intend to report our Family metrics as key metrics in place of DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchang\\nCommission.\\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products acros\\nlarge online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we ar\\ncontinually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, an\\nfrom time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may b\\nimpacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies o\\nadjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology.\\nFamily Metrics\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do no\\nseek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of uniqu\\npeople using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek t\\nattribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individua\\npeople behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group o\\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. W\\nestimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, w\\nestimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possibl\\nthat the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicat\\nchanges or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated agains\\nuser survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use dat\\nsignals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherentl\\nsubject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our dat\\nlimitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from differen\\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer\\nTable of Contents\\ndata signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids user\\nare included in our Family metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process fo\\ncalculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability o\\naccuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new dat\\nsignals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluat\\nthe broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used fo\\npurposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation i\\nbased on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook an\\nInstagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violatin\\naccounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts\\nmake product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates o\\nthe percentage of our MAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may var\\nsignificantly from our estimates.\\nThe numbers of Family DAP and MAP discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPP, do not include users on our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP\\nrespectively, based on their other activities on our Family products.\\nFacebook Metrics\\nWe regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principa\\naccount. We divide \"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities ar\\npermitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violat\\nour terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making thi\\ndetermination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or othe\\nbehavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms\\nregulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, includin\\nthrough the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broade\\npopulation of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher i\\ndeveloping markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4-5% of ou\\nworldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Nigeria\\nand Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and\\nTable of Contents\\nMAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\\nThe numbers of DAUs and MAUs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPU, do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify a\\nDAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.\\nUser Geography\\nOur data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user\\'s IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect th\\nuser\\'s actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user\\'s actual location. The methodologies used t\\nmeasure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\\nTable of Contents\\nPART I\\nItem 1.Business\\nOverview\\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\\nAll of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life. We build technology that helps people connect and share, find communities, and grow businesses. Our useful an\\nengaging products enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what i\\ngoing on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, an\\nstay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe i\\nthe next evolution in social technology. Our vision for the metaverse does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in th\\nvery early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps t\\nmarketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platforms enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appea\\nin multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL reflects our efforts to develop the metaverse and generates revenue from sales of consumer hardwar\\nproducts, software and content.\\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities, and the majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2022, 82% of our total costs and expenses were recognized i\\nFoA and 18% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $71.79 billion in 2022 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps an\\nour advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and othe\\nfoundational technologies for the metaverse. Our total RL investments were $15.88 billion in 2022 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. As these ar\\nfundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the metaverse ecosystem develops, many products for the metaverse may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult t\\npredict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent o\\ngenerating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and wil\\nunlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\\nFamily of Apps Products\\n• Facebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It\\'s a place for people to share life\\'s moments and discuss what\\'s happening, nurture and buil\\nrelationships, discover and connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups, and more.\\n• Instagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, Video, Live, Shops, and messaging are places where people and creators can connect an\\nexpress themselves through photos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shop from their favorite businesses.\\n• Messenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio and vide\\ncalls.\\nTable of Contents\\n• WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses around the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\\nReality Labs Products\\nMany of our metaverse investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products that are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. Thi\\nincludes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets people control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) an\\nhardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the near term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse experiences through Reality Labs\\' augmented and virtual reality products that help people fee\\nconnected, anytime, anywhere. Our current product offerings include Meta Quest virtual reality devices, as well as software and content available through the Meta Quest Store, which enable a range of socia\\nexperiences that allow people to defy physical distance, including gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. For example, we have launched Horizon Worlds, a social platform where people can interact with friends\\nmeet new people, play games, and attend virtual events, and Horizon Workrooms, a virtual reality space for teams to connect and collaborate at work. As part of our virtual reality initiatives, we have also introduce\\nmixed reality capabilities through our Meta Reality system on Meta Quest Pro, which allows users to experience the immersion and presence of virtual reality while still being grounded in the physical world. As part o\\nour augmented reality initiatives, we have introduced Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, which let people stay more present through hands-free interaction, and Meta Spark, a platform that allows creators and businesses t\\nbuild augmented reality experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our apps. In general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our virtua\\nreality and social platform efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our augmented reality efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term\\nresearch and development projects. For example, in 2023, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our augmented reality initiatives, approximately 40% on our virtual realit\\ninitiatives, and approximately 10% on social platforms and other initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and ou\\nexpectations are subject to change, including as the metaverse ecosystem and our business strategies evolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understandin\\nof the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\\nCompetition\\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to user\\nonline, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in ever\\naspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing o\\nprospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retai\\ndevelopers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. A\\nwe introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through th\\napplication of new technologies such as AI, we may become subject to additional competition.\\nTechnology\\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their socia\\ninteractions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and virtual reality increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computin\\nneeds continue to expand. We make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investin\\nin protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments i\\nAI and machine learning, including to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, to enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting\\nand measurement capabilities, and\\nTable of Contents\\nto develop new product features using generative AI.\\nSales and Operations\\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers an\\nproviding support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well a\\nthrough advertising agencies and resellers. We operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direc\\ncustomer support to our users and partners.\\nMarketing\\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we hav\\ninvested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world.\\nIntellectual Property\\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosur\\nagreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patent\\nand patent applications from third parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of ou\\npatents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interprete\\nin ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity\\nintellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence and machine learning, electronic contracts and othe\\ncommunications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions\\nanti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations ca\\nimpose different obligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\\nThese U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significan\\nchange. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interprete\\nand applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in which we displa\\ncontent to our users, moderate content, or obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely affect our financial results. In the United States, th\\nU.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to review a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) is at issue. In addition\\nthere have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significan\\nchanges to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including dat\\nshared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we ar\\nrestricted from sharing data among our products and services,\\nTable of Contents\\nit could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfe\\nframework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon whic\\nMeta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. On July 6, 2022, we received a draft decision from the Irish Data Protectio\\nCommission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland\\'s reliance on SCCs in respect of European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with th\\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Separately, on March 25, 2022, th\\nEuropean Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executiv\\nOrder on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on December 13, 2022, the European Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new EU-U.S. DPF\\nWe believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first quarter of 2023. Although the E.O. is a significant and positive step, if no adequacy decision is adopted by the European Commission and we ar\\nunable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from the European Union to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products an\\nservices, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, w\\nhave implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal dat\\nbreach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. Th\\ninterpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR\\'s consistency mechanism, which may lead t\\nsignificant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject t\\nsignificant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to user\\nin their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and similar laws recently enacted by other states also establish certain transparency rules an\\ncreate certain data privacy rights for users. In addition, the European Union\\'s ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includ\\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, ou\\nadvertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that coul\\nimpose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including i\\nareas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable agains\\ndesignated gatekeeper companies in early 2024. We expect the DMA will cause us to incur significant compliance costs and make additional changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under th\\nDMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, th\\nDigital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, will impose new restrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantly increase ou\\ncompliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such as India and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protectio\\nrequirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services i\\ncertain countries, or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising service\\nor our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, an\\naround the world, particularly in the areas of privacy and data protection, including with respect to minors, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil\\nTable of Contents\\nrights, content moderation, and competition. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federa\\nTrade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other matters, requires us to maintain a comprehensive privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by\\ngovernment or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies)\\ninterrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, diver\\nresources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nHuman Capital\\nAt Meta, our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People are at the heart of every connection we empower, and we are proud of our unique compan\\nculture. We strive to build diverse teams across engineering, product design, marketing, and other areas to further our mission.\\nAs we look forward, we expect the lasting effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic will change how we work and who we reach. We are proud of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic both internally an\\nexternally. Employee benefits were robust and established quickly: we implemented 15 days of subsidized backup care for child, adult, or eldercare; we paid emergency leave to help address short-term or transitiona\\nneeds; and we established a temporary stipend to help employees work from home, to name just a few of the benefits.\\nWe are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our global workforce, and we are focused on supporting our people in doing the best work of their careers, no matter where they are located. Fo\\nexample:\\n• Location is flexible but presence is essential. As of September 30, 2022, 83% of managers at Meta had direct reports in a different location, and 24% of our employees were fully remote.\\n• Remote work has helped us reach new talent in a competitive tech landscape and broaden our representation. We have seen that candidates who accepted remote job offers were more often underrepresente\\npeople.\\n• Beginning March 2023, we are permitting employees in eligible roles to transfer to any Meta office within their country of employment. We expect distributed teams to establish strong norms that suppor\\nefficiency, including more predictable and coordinated in-person working time.\\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of online commerce led to accelerated revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration tha\\nwould continue even after the pandemic ended. Instead, not only did online commerce return to prior trends, but the more challenging macroeconomic environment and limitations on our ad targeting and measuremen\\ntools, among other factors, contributed to a decline in our revenue.\\nTo address this new environment, we took a number of steps to become a more capital efficient company and, in November 2022, made one of the most difficult changes in Meta\\'s history and announced a layof\\nof approximately 11,000 employees. The cost reduction efforts that we announced, including our plans to scale back budgets, reduce company perks, shrink our real estate footprint, and restructure teams to increas\\nefficiency alone would not bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth and we had to implement the layoff. We made it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and announced a package for U.S\\nemployees that included:\\n• Severance: 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service.\\n• Paid time off: payment for all remaining paid time off.\\nTable of Contents\\n• Restricted stock unit vesting: receipt of November 2022 vesting for outstanding employee restricted stock unit awards.\\n• Health insurance: coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families for six months.\\n• Career services: three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads.\\n• Immigration support: dedicated immigration specialists to help guide employees based on their needs.\\nWe offered similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States, taking into account local employment laws.\\nEmployee Learning and Development\\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled and efficient workforce. In addition to permitting employees to seek education reimbursement, we offer career development opportunities an\\nwork experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we utilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self\\nservice resources, learning communities, and coaching engagements.\\nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help understand how employees feel about working at Meta and what we can do to improve their experience. Our surveys help us measure company\\nmanager, and personal experience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those that have been administered daily to an ongoing random sample of employees, allows us to measure real-time sentimen\\naround emerging events and company changes. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the company.\\nHealth and Well-being\\nMeta\\'s health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them reach their personal well-being goals. Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physica\\nand mental health, create financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community. Programs are designed and funded to support needs like autism care, cancer care\\ntransgender services, holistic well-being, and mental health programs, which represent a few of the ways we support our employees and their dependents.\\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\nWe work to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.\\nWe offer full-time fully remote positions, including in locations where we do not have offices, which has deepened the diversity of our candidate pool. As published in our Diversity Report in July 2022, we saw\\nthat providing remote optionality increased the diversity of the overall composition of our workforce: U.S candidates who accepted remote job offers were substantially more likely to be Black, Hispanic, Nativ\\nAmerican, Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, veterans and/or people with disabilities, and globally, candidates who accepted remote job offers were more likely to be women.\\nAs part of our 2022 Diversity Report, we published our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce data. As of June\\u200930, 2022, our global employee base was comprised of 37.1% females an\\n62.9% males, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 46.5% Asian, 37.6%\\u2009White, 6.7% Hispanic, 4.9%\\u2009Black, 4.0% two or more ethnicities, and 0.3% additional groups (includin\\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander).\\nWe want our products to work for the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to do that. To aid in this effort, we have taken steps to reduce bias from our hiring processes and performanc\\nmanagement systems.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe have also invested in learning opportunities to identify and reduce inherent bias through Diversity, Equity and Inclusion trainings for our employees and enhanced learning and development courses. I\\naddition, we offer career development programs to employees, including opportunities for women leaders at Meta to connect, support and grow together and programs to help ensure that we develop leaders of color\\nbuild a more diverse leadership pipeline and foster a culture of sponsorship through leader advocacy.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Our employees\\' total compensation package includes market-competitiv\\nsalary, bonuses or sales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed t\\nour long-term success. We have conducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2022, we announced that our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equity acros\\ngenders globally and race in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their dependents with resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family\\nfinance, community, and time away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family building benefits, family care resources, retirement savings plans, access to tax and legal services, and Meta Resource Groups t\\nbuild community at Meta.\\nCorporate Information\\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\\n•our ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\\n•the loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\\n•reduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\\n•ineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners;\\n•failure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\\n•our ability to compete effectively;\\n•fluctuations in our financial results;\\n•unfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\\n•the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\\n•acquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\\n•our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service;\\n•operating our business in multiple countries around the world;\\n•litigation, including class action lawsuits;\\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\\n•government restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to sell advertising, in their countries;\\n•complex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations;\\nTable of Contents\\n•the impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and investigations by privacy and competition authorities;\\n•our ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC);\\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\\n•the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents or undesirable activity on our platform;\\n•our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\\n•limitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual class structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of ou\\noutstanding capital stock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\\nThe size of our user base and our users\\' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success i\\nadding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines i\\nthe size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of othe\\nfactors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users\\' engagement with our products and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitica\\nconditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at different points during the pandemic, and may continu\\nto have a varied impact on the size and engagement of our active user base in the future. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these service\\nwere then prohibited by the Russian government, which contributed to slight declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of DAUs and MAUs on Facebook in Europe in the first quarter and the second quarte\\nof 2022, as well as a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the total number of MAUs on Facebook in the second quarter of 2022. Any future declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impac\\nour ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A\\nnumber of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will no\\nexperience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new an\\ndifferent products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\\n•users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\\n•we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\\n•users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\\nTable of Contents\\n•users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\\n•user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;\\n•we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of marke\\nacceptance;\\n•there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concern\\nrelated to privacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\\n•we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\\n•we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\\n•we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products;\\n•users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise available;\\n•there are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect our products or users;\\n•we are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of Europea\\nregulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the Unite\\nStates is invalid;\\n•there is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-focused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, i\\nconnection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union\\'s ePrivacy Directive, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, o\\notherwise;\\n•technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or simila\\ncontent, or users feel their experience is diminished as a result of our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our platform;\\n•we adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or we take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users o\\nthe general public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board regarding content on our platform;\\n•we elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizin\\nthe young adult experience in the long term);\\n•we make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;\\nTable of Contents\\n•initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, ou\\ncompetitors, or other third parties, or otherwise;\\n•third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\\n•there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by government\\nthat affect the accessibility of our products in their countries (for example, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user growth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and servic\\nrestrictions imposed by the Russian government);\\n•we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\\n•we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of ou\\nor their user data practices; or\\n•our current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications, reduce user activity on our products b\\nmaking it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party applications.\\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagemen\\nparticularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagemen\\ncould render our products less attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business\\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase level\\nof user engagement and monetization in order to grow revenue.\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm our business.\\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments wit\\nus. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commi\\nto us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for an\\nother reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversel\\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the demand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in whic\\ncase our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\\n•decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\\n•our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\\n•product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared b\\nmarketers on our products;\\nTable of Contents\\n•our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\\n•our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\\n•changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browse\\nproviders such as Apple and Google;\\n•adverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure th\\neffectiveness of advertising;\\n•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, such as our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels o\\nother video or messaging products;\\n•reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform;\\n•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools\\n•loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\\n•limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodie\\ndetermining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\\n•changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\\n•decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools\\ncontent on our products, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products (including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversigh\\nBoard), developers with applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\\n•reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about bran\\nsafety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations;\\n•the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads, including as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in th\\nfuture in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the Digital Markets Act (DMA), other laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, tha\\nimpact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;\\n•the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\\n•changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\\n•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\\n•changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\\nTable of Contents\\n•the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies (for example, the war in Ukraine\\nand service restrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely affected our advertising business in Europe and other regions).\\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand fo\\nour ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, and changes to the regulatory\\nenvironment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect ou\\nadvertising revenue.\\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant an\\neffective ads to our users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, an\\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the CPRA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in th\\nnumber of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced produc\\nchanges that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance, decisions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions, such as the DMA, may require us t\\nmake additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, we expect to implement additional changes in response to th\\nDecember 2022 decision by the IDPC regarding the legal basis for our delivery of behavioral advertising in Europe.\\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and applicatio\\ndevelopers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operatin\\nsystem that reduce our and other iOS developers\\' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willin\\nto commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads an\\nother experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in connection with the GDPR and other regulatory frameworks.\\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has bee\\nnegatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in th\\nfuture, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users wil\\ncontinue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we d\\nnot control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handse\\nmanufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our product\\nfunctionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fee\\nrelated to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads have in the past adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect,\\nTable of Contents\\nthe usage of our products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide th\\nmost relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own advertising business. We expect that an\\nsimilar changes to its, Google\\'s, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high qualit\\nmobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handse\\nmanufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operat\\neffectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to acces\\nor use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regardin\\nthe distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators o\\nmobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits\\nIn the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our busines\\ncould be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the futur\\nmay negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, bot\\nindependently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologie\\nwith which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which ma\\nadversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with thes\\nefforts. We are also making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, including to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, and develop new\\nproduct features using generative AI. These efforts, including the introduction of new products or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethica\\nconcerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. We have also invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging product\\nto support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messagin\\nover the long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging services, as well as facilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which ar\\nsubject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, w\\nmay fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experienc\\nand will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce ou\\nability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits o\\nour storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers\\' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we updat\\nour feed display and ranking algorithms or other product features to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and\\nTable of Contents\\nmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products, which could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we also change the size\\nfrequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect th\\ndistribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, o\\nintroduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growin\\nusers and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or service\\nthat we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. Thes\\ndecisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\\nWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in ou\\nbusiness and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies\\ncontinued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop i\\naccordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as ou\\nunderstanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmente\\nreality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationship\\nwith key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our metaverse efforts may also divert resources an\\nmanagement attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to suppor\\nthese efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in th\\nUnited States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, competition, content regulation, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our product\\nand services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investments may not b\\nsuccessful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, an\\ndevelopers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products\\nwhich we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertiser\\nmay affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue t\\nexperience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, includin\\nactions or decisions in connection with elections, the COVID-19 pandemic, or geopolitical events, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands. Fo\\nexample, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents relating to, amon\\nother things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in March 2018\\nwe announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\\nTable of Contents\\nviolation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or t\\notherwise enforce our policies or address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that ar\\ndeemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleadin\\n(or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of ou\\nproducts or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic, geopolitical events, or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions o\\nrecommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, or b\\nour decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us t\\nmake substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speec\\nand advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand\\nor if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products.\\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications that integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not b\\nsuccessful in building, growing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties\\nrather than building products that integrate with our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may no\\nbe successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users o\\nour products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, applications integrated with ou\\nproducts. In addition, as part of our efforts related to privacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have announced several product change\\nthat restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or will adversely affect, ou\\nrelationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we are unable to continue to buil\\nand maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reac\\nconsumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitat\\nthe ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people wh\\nuse our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. W\\nalso compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as othe\\ncompanies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the application of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, we may become subject t\\nadditional competition.\\nTable of Contents\\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. Fo\\nexample, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow ou\\ncompetitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with othe\\nproducts and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other product\\nand services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our busines\\nwould likely be harmed.\\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketin\\ncampaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver\\ntarget, or measure the effectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicat\\nwith our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, eac\\nof Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertisin\\nindustry, to target and measure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which woul\\nnegatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they wil\\nnot negatively affect our business and financial results.\\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\\n•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors\\' products;\\n•the size and composition of our user base;\\n•the engagement of users with our products and competing products;\\n•our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\\n•the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors\\' products;\\n•our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;\\n•our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\\n•our ability to monetize our products;\\n•the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\\n•customer service and support efforts;\\n•marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments;\\n•our ability to establish and maintain developers\\' interest in building applications that integrate with our products;\\n•our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;\\nTable of Contents\\n•changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;\\n•acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\\n•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers;\\n•our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\\n•our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad impressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenu\\nand results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecas\\nour future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered b\\ncompanies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\\n•our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad impressions;\\n•our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\\n•our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period;\\n•fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, o\\nother factors;\\n•the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\\n•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\\n•changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browse\\nproviders such as Apple and Google;\\n•the pricing of our ads and other products;\\n•the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\\n•our ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future;\\n•changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;\\n•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\\nTable of Contents\\n•increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technica\\ninfrastructure;\\n•costs related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing changes to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulator\\nactions, or decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\\n•costs and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\\n•our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\\n•costs related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies;\\n•charges associated with impairment or abandonment of any assets on our balance sheet, including as a result of changes to our real property lease arrangements and data center assets;\\n•our ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner;\\n•system failures or outages or government blocking that prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;\\n•breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\\n•changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party actions;\\n•fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\\n•refunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\\n•share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\\n•adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\\n•changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection, and content, or actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\\n•the overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integratin\\nintellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\\n•the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect th\\neffective tax rate of that period;\\n•tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently under by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we hav\\nanticipated;\\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\\n•trading activity in our share repurchase program;\\nTable of Contents\\n•fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our non-marketable equity securities, and in interest rates;\\n•the incurrence of indebtedness or our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms;\\n•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\\n•changes in regional or global business, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the other factors described above.\\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies, product decisions, product quality, litigation or regulator\\nactivity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, th\\nsubstance or enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of ou\\nproducts or services on user well-being, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been th\\nsubject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negativ\\npublicity related to these topics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee. I\\naddition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services, including in connectio\\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical events, and elections in the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user bas\\nand marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degree\\nfrom time to time.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes our business to other risks.\\nWe are subject to public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has previously significantly impacted, and may in the future impact, our business and results of operations. For example, th\\nCOVID-19 pandemic resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time to time to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on busines\\nactivity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders, which have previously caused, and may in the future cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. These developments led t\\nvolatility in the demand for and pricing of our advertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may experience similar effects in the future. In addition to the impact on our advertising business\\nthe pandemic exposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\\n•volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as a result of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\\n•delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\\n•increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or othe\\nillicit or objectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity; \\n•significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\\n•illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and\\nTable of Contents\\n•increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements.\\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory actions against us.\\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and augmented reality, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investment\\nare not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data the\\nshare with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, a\\nwe continue to invest in new and unproven technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. We have recentl\\nundertaken cost reduction measures in light of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect these or other business initiatives, and some of these measures have involved, and may in the futur\\ninvolve, up-front charges and outlays of cash to reduce certain longer-term expenses. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties in connection with lega\\nand regulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as part of our efforts related to building the metaverse\\nSome of these investments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the advers\\nfinancial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2022 overall operating profit by approximately $13.72 billion, and we expect ou\\ninvestments to increase in the future. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time ma\\nenter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions o\\nfavorable terms, or at all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, in 2022, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority directed us to divest our Giphy acquisition. In addition, in 2022\\nthe FTC filed lawsuits against us to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that w\\nwill realize expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic investments.\\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtednes\\nalso results in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equit\\nsecurities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to ou\\nstockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price o\\nour Class A common stock.\\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. Th\\neffectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by th\\ncompanies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or othe\\nstrategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions\\nTable of Contents\\nmay also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors ma\\nadversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.\\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, an\\nwe may not manage these processes successfully. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which has in the past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, i\\nsignificant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail t\\nsuccessfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users an\\nengagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may i\\nthe future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary t\\navoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use ou\\nproducts as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to varying degree\\nfrom time to time. For example, in October 2021, a combination of an error and a bug resulted in an approximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on ou\\nproducts continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technica\\ninfrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodat\\nthese increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, advers\\nweather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Global climate change could result in certain types o\\nnatural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in users being subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructur\\nand user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other costs to maintai\\nthe availability or performance of our products in connection with any such events.\\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increase\\ntraffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases ou\\nvulnerability to problems with the services they provide. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, supply and labor shortages and other disruptions i\\nlogistics and the supply chain for our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes to our procurement practices, and in the future we may not be able to procure sufficient components\\nequipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.\\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require unfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwis\\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructur\\nprimarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around th\\nworld, including in emerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges, among others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the future suspend\\ncertain of these projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects, including due to any shortage of labor necessary i\\nbuilding portions of such projects, or availability of components, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result o\\nthe pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products, or impairment of asset\\non our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started t\\nfully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreig\\ngovernment, or our response to such government action, has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrad\\nthe quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP)) and Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), ar\\ncalculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measuremen\\nthere are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are als\\nsusceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology\\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to ou\\nhistorical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend t\\nupdate previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology.\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do no\\nseek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of uniqu\\npeople using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek t\\nattribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individua\\npeople behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group o\\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. W\\nestimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, w\\nestimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possibl\\nthat the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,\\nTable of Contents\\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated agains\\nuser survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use dat\\nsignals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherentl\\nsubject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our dat\\nlimitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from differen\\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user account\\nand primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our Family metrics, we d\\nnot seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as \\nresult of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics\\nas well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes\\nor other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. I\\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used fo\\npurposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation i\\nbased on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook an\\nInstagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violatin\\naccounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts\\nmake product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates o\\nthe percentage of our MAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may var\\nsignificantly from our estimates.\\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principa\\naccount. We divide \"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities ar\\npermitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violat\\nour terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making thi\\ndetermination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or othe\\nbehavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms\\nregulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, includin\\nthrough the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broade\\npopulation of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nTable of Contents\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher i\\ndeveloping markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4-5% of ou\\nworldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Nigeria\\nand Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU an\\nMAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliabl\\nbecause a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user\\'s IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accuratel\\nreflect the user\\'s actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user\\'s actual location. The methodologie\\nused to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations an\\njudgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in ou\\nterminology or methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well a\\nmarketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discove\\nmaterial inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products tha\\ndeliver ad impressions, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.\\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our scale.\\nOur employee headcount and the scale and complexity of our business have increased significantly over time. The scale of our business and breadth of our products create significant challenges for ou\\nmanagement, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties, and maintaining information technology systems and interna\\ncontrols and procedures that support the scale and complexity of our business. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so ou\\nmanagement may not be able to manage our scale effectively. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial, and management processes and systems, manage ou\\nheadcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our personnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In addition, from time to time, w\\nimplement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022, we announced a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees and initiated severa\\nmeasures to scale down our office facilities. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and adapt complex organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain th\\nbenefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.\\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, an\\nlegal risks that could affect our financial results.\\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more tha\\n100 different languages,\\nTable of Contents\\nand we have offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Ou\\nproducts are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are no\\ngenerally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. I\\naddition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\\n•political, social, or economic instability;\\n•risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, conten\\ntrade compliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\\n•potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities;\\n•enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries;\\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\\n•foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely\\nand impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;\\n•higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\\n•enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\\n•burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content moderation, data localization, data protection, e-commerce and payments, and regulator\\noversight;\\n•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\\n•difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficultie\\narising from personnel working remotely;\\n•compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\\n•geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and pandemics.\\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws o\\nregulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and expor\\ncontrols, trade restrictions, and sanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they ma\\nseek to impose against companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and other laws, rules, and regulations.\\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modif\\nour operations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks described above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financia\\nresults.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.\\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time t\\ntime have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components w\\npurchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers\\' expectations, or findings of our consume\\nhardware products to be defective.\\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result o\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negativel\\nimpact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engag\\nwith fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements wit\\nthem. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions b\\ngovernments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or logistics disruptions.\\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance\\nhealth and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them violates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, o\\nimplements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes i\\nconsumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and other factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between th\\ntime inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to tim\\nwe have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new\\ninternational markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory o\\ncomponents may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results o\\noperations.\\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our busines\\noperations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against u\\ntypically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class action and othe\\nlawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, user well-being, employment, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or othe\\nclaims related to the use of consumer hardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class actio\\nsuits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\\nTable of Contents\\nviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a forme\\nemployee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of th\\npotential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged recommendation of and/or failure to remov\\nharmful content. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, o\\nundesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigatio\\nto which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarl\\nunfavorable terms, which has occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business\\ndevelop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and othe\\njurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject to regula\\nreview and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompan\\narrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position\\nresults of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 throug\\n2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS\\'s position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.\\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination i\\nuncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate\\nAlthough we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and ma\\nmaterially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in ta\\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles.\\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretation\\nof existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our ta\\nobligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States o\\nglobally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countrie\\nhave recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change th\\nmanner in which we operate our business.\\nTable of Contents\\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of th\\nexisting framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. In 2021, more than 140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum ta\\nrate of 15%, among other provisions. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations ar\\nuncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include change\\nto the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions hav\\nproposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union stat\\naid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate\\nincrease the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and resul\\nin taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share\\nbased compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2022, tax shortfalls recognized from share-based compensatio\\nincreased our provision for income taxes by $471 million and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such shortfalls. In future periods in which our stock price varies i\\ncomparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earning\\nin a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in ou\\nstock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We tes\\ngoodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds th\\nfair value of the assets would be recognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined\\nwhich would negatively affect our results of operations.\\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Although we have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Zuckerberg, the agreemen\\nhas no specific duration and constitutes at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members o\\nmanagement as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.\\nTable of Contents\\nIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. In particular, we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hirin\\ntechnical personnel, particularly for engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other companies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employee\\nprovided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incu\\nsubstantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected b\\nstock price volatility. In addition, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain ou\\nexisting personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control th\\noutcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay\\ndefer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation o\\nsuch a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative t\\nthe Class B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as \\nresult of his position as our CEO and his ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will b\\ntransferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to b\\nin the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement, i\\nhis own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price o\\nour stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire an\\nspecific number of shares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading pric\\nof our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in\\ntheir countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impos\\nother restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or i\\ncurrently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of thei\\nlaws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Securit\\nLaw that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend\\nTable of Contents\\nuser services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations i\\nHong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022\\naccess to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue an\\nbusiness in the region. It is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked o\\nrestricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers serving advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminate\\nour China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take othe\\naction against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social medi\\ncompanies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown o\\nFacebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or othe\\nrestrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we fac\\nother restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated\\nand our financial results could be adversely affected.\\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and othe\\nmatters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost o\\noperations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics\\nencryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligenc\\nand machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation\\neconomic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activitie\\nin certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consume\\nprotection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\\nThese U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significan\\nchange. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interprete\\nand applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in which we displa\\ncontent to our users, moderate content, or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversel\\naffect our financial results.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including dat\\nshared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for dat\\ntransferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the othe\\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as \\nbasis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, ou\\ncontinued reliance on\\nTable of Contents\\nSCCs will be the subject of future regulatory consideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland\\'s reliance o\\nSCCs in respect of European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers should therefore be suspended. In Februar\\n2022, we received a revised preliminary draft decision in which the IDPC maintained its preliminary conclusion that these transfers should be suspended. The IDPC\\'s draft decision was then further refined and share\\non July 6, 2022 with other European data protection regulators (CSAs) as part of the GDPR\\'s consistency mechanism. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they ha\\nreached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signal\\nIntelligence Activities (E.O.), and on December 13, 2022, the European Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new EU-U.S. DPF. On January 19, 2023, the IDPC referred the inquiry to \\nvote by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), pursuant to the dispute resolution process under Article 65 GDPR, in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensus could not be reached betwee\\nconcerned supervisory authorities. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first quarter of 2023. Although the E.O. is a significant and positive step, if no adequacy decision is adopted by th\\nEuropean Commission and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from the European Union to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number o\\nour most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we hav\\nbeen managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the 2016 and 2021 updates to WhatsApp\\'s terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Met\\nproducts and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricte\\nfrom sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financia\\nresults.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, w\\nhave implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. Th\\nGDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation a\\nwell as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of th\\nGDPR\\'s consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount o\\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-relate\\nrequirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), also establishes certai\\ntransparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is share\\nwith third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject t\\ninterpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Fo\\nexample, state regulators in California and Colorado are considering adopting regulations that could further limit how companies can use personal information for advertising purposes. In Europe, regulators continue t\\nissue guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive\\'s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies, and may impose specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of suc\\ntechnologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance\\nChanges to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. Similarly, there are \\nnumber of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations i\\nareas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, merger\\nand acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies in early 2024. We expect th\\nDMA will cause us to incur significant compliance costs and make additional changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulator\\nengagement. Pending or future proposals to\\nTable of Contents\\nmodify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023\\nwill impose new restrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantly increase our compliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, som\\ncountries, such as India and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase th\\ncost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict ou\\nability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes includin\\nincreased compliance costs, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention\\nand remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which\\ncould cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business.\\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are an\\nexpect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy and dat\\nprotection, including with respect to minors, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and competition. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory order\\nor consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union and other jurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking t\\nrestrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and othe\\ngovernment inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with thir\\nparties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020\\nAmong other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys genera\\ninquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal dat\\nbreaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. We have in the past been, and may in the future be\\nsubject to fines and requirements to changes to our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, we are subject to a lawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the “tag suggestions\\nand other facial recognition features on our products.\\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of ou\\nbusiness, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or socia\\nmedia services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company\\nIn addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December 2020, we als\\nbecame subject to lawsuits by the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violate\\nantitrust laws, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general bot\\nsought a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in Decembe\\n2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. We are also subjec\\nto other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example,\\nTable of Contents\\nbeginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee.\\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for ou\\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user dat\\npractices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affec\\nour business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CPRA, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources an\\nmodifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipate\\nregulatory and legislative requirements around the world, such as the CPRA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and DSA. In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consen\\norder that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a proces\\nto regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging an\\ncostly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in complianc\\nprocesses, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. I\\naddition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, we believe ou\\nability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will requir\\nsignificant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, an\\nfrom time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues aris\\nin the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For example, we will be subject to new restriction\\nand requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services and product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. If we are unabl\\nto successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR, CPRA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are found to be in violation o\\nthe consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, or other penalties, and we ma\\nalso be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on\\nour platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products, including our policies, algorithms, and enforcement action\\nwith respect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectua\\nproperty rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, online safety, products liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. Fo\\nexample, we have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. The potential risk\\nrelating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions\\nTable of Contents\\noutside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, th\\nEuropean Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states ar\\ncurrently implementing into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states have begu\\nto implement. In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to review a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Ac\\n(Section 230) is at issue. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as t\\nimpose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in th\\nUnited States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders restricting or blockin\\nour services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in th\\nfuture, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle Eas\\nAsia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certai\\ntypes of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey, and we have been subjec\\nto fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also has required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices, increase our costs, o\\notherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted conten\\nor to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states\\' laws implementing the European Copyright Directiv\\nmay also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services will be subject to new restrictions and requirements, and our compliance costs may significantly increase, as a result of th\\nDigital Services Act in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, and potentially other content-related legislative developments such as proposed online safety bills in Ireland and th\\nUnited Kingdom. Certain countries have also proposed legislation that may require us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products. In the United States, changes to the protections available unde\\nSection 230 or the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations\\nwhich could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual, and digital goods from merchants and developers that offer applications using our Payment\\ninfrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere\\nincluding those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consume\\nprotection, charitable fundraising, trade sanctions, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governin\\ngambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulator\\nuncertainty, we have received certain payments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic an\\nforeign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we ar\\nfound to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any o\\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with ba\\ntransactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third parties; restrictions on the\\nTable of Contents\\ninvestment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the futur\\nundertake additional payments initiatives, including as part of our metaverse efforts, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect ou\\nbusiness.\\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users\\' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage\\nprocessing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, o\\npayment information from users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminis\\nour competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our system\\nin the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such a\\nspamming, spreading misinformation, or other objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature o\\nour products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highl\\nsophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform als\\nincrease the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products\\nimpair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due t\\nsoftware bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors\\' information technology systems or offerings; governmen\\nsurveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose informatio\\nin order to gain access to our data or our users\\' data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have develope\\nsystems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assur\\nyou that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. The changes in our work environment as a result of certai\\npersonnel working remotely could also impact the security of our systems, as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly.\\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or we\\napplications integrated with our products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us. However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere t\\nadequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users\\' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.\\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject t\\na variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users o\\ngovernment authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past an\\nwhich could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also resul\\nin a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nTable of Contents\\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\\'s code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certai\\nprofile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. An\\nsuch inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by thir\\nparties, including investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. As a result of these efforts we have discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discove\\nand announce, additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, includin\\nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by th\\nindependent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use of user data o\\nour systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people\\'s safet\\non- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any suc\\nincidents. Consequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to ou\\nbusiness, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages\\ndivert management\\'s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in ou\\nsystems, could adversely affect our business.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, ou\\nproducts and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and wil\\nin the future contain, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherentl\\nmay be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack tha\\nexploited a vulnerability in Facebook\\'s code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations withi\\nthe software and hardware on which we rely, or human error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use ou\\nproducts, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors\\ncompromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as t\\nhow their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitment\\nreliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, o\\nassociated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, los\\nof marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nTable of Contents\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well a\\ntrademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspect\\nof our intellectual property, and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Thir\\nparties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. I\\naddition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant tim\\nand expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products o\\nconcepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we develope\\navailable under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to licens\\nor disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use o\\nappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any o\\nthese events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significan\\nimpact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringemen\\nmisappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert thei\\nrights in order to extract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increas\\nour exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved i\\na number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow\\nDefending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained i\\nall cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some o\\nall of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorabl\\njudgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may hav\\nto seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\\'s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As \\nresult, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significan\\neffort and expense, could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes an\\nlitigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\\nTable of Contents\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.0\\nper share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2022. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has i\\nthe past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\\n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;\\n•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\\n•actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectation\\nof investors;\\n•additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\\n•investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\\n•announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\\n•announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\\n•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and competitors;\\n•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\\n•the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\\n•media coverage of our business and financial performance;\\n•lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\\n•adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulator\\nbodies;\\n•trading activity in our share repurchase program; and\\n•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses to these events.\\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We ar\\ncurrently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies\\nthe disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings result\\nfor the fourth quarter of 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention o\\nmanagement from our business, and adversely affect our business.\\nTable of Contents\\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchas\\nprogram, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of you\\nshares increases.\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common\\nstock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of our Class B common stock, including our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold \\nmajority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B commo\\nstock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning o\\ncharitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain thei\\nshares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of th\\ncombined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are w\\nrequired to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committe\\nor an independent nominating function. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded t\\nstockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to som\\ninvestors or otherwise harm our stock price.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in \\nbusiness combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. I\\naddition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\\n•until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change i\\ncontrol of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\\n•we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than \\nmajority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\\nTable of Contents\\n•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws wil\\nrequire the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\\n•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only b\\nour board of directors and not by stockholders;\\n•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes o\\ndirectors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\\n•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting o\\nstockholders and not by written consent;\\n•only our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\\n•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\\n•our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\\n•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\\nTable of Contents\\nItem 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 2.Properties\\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and leased approximately 10 million square feet of office and building space for our corporate headquarter\\nand in the surrounding areas. However, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, we made a decision to either sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases. We also owned an\\nleased approximately 62 acres of land to be developed to accommodate anticipated future growth.\\nIn addition, we have offices in more than 90 cities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. We also own 21 data centers locations globally.\\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additiona\\ninformation regarding our facilities consolidation efforts.\\nWe believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs.\\nItem 3.Legal Proceedings\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officer\\nalleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared suc\\ndata with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United State\\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. Thes\\ntwo actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user dat\\npractices. On September 25, 2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed i\\nthe consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complain\\nwas filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs file\\na notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. With respect to the multiple putative class actions filed against us beginning o\\nMarch 20, 2018 alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States wer\\nconsolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action\\nOn December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us and is subject to court approval. In addition, our platform and user dat\\npractices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the Unite\\nStates, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and t\\nsignificantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us t\\nadditional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholde\\nderivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as wel\\nas our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims agains\\ncertain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead\\nTable of Contents\\nplaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches an\\nprivacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminar\\ndraft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland\\'s reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data does no\\nachieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that transfers of such user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. In February 2022, we received a revise\\npreliminary draft decision in which the IDPC maintained its preliminary conclusion that these transfers should be suspended. The IDPC\\'s draft decision was then further refined and shared on July 6, 2022 with othe\\nEuropean data protection regulators (CSAs) as part of the GDPR\\'s consistency mechanism. Separately, on October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United State\\nSignals Intelligence Activities, and on December 13, 2022, the European Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new European Union-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. On January 19, 2023\\nthe IDPC referred the inquiry to a vote by the European Data Protection Board, pursuant to the dispute resolution process under Article 65 GDPR, in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensus coul\\nnot be reached between concerned supervisory authorities. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Ou\\nbusiness is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters\\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceeding) could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources an\\nthe attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Suc\\ninvestigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well a\\nour acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. Distric\\nCourt for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherma\\nAct, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrus\\ninvestigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us i\\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 201\\nand by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorney\\ngeneral both sought a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28\\n2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC\\'s complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general\\'s case without prejudice\\nOn July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and that appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On August 19\\n2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC\\'s amended complain\\nMultiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection wit\\nthese acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated i\\nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amende\\nconsolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in th\\nputative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In addition, on July 27, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking to preliminaril\\nenjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited as an alleged violation of antitrust law. The FTC subsequently filed a related complaint in\\nTable of Contents\\ntheir administrative court seeking to permanently enjoin the transaction as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and seeking other relief as well. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorousl\\ndefending them. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Unio\\ncompetition rules. The result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and th\\nattention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal and California state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\\nin teenage users, resulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class action alleging similar harms was also filed in California state court on behalf of users under the age of 13 and three school district\\nrecently filed public nuisance claims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The state court proceeding\\nare now pending before a trial judge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. We are also subject to government investigations an\\nrequests from multiple regulators concerning the use of our products, and the related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to governmen\\ninvestigations and requests relating to a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcemen\\npractices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021\\nmultiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws\\nbreach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws i\\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified damages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increase\\ndemand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022\\nthe court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs\\' claims, but permitted its fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs\\' motion for class certification. On June 21, 2022\\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court\\'s class certification order, and the district court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit i\\nwithout merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\\nIn July 2017, an individual filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and other companies for allegedly violating the Anti-Terrorism Act by aiding, abetting, an\\nproviding material support to an organization that committed an international terrorist act, and seeking unspecified damages. In October 2018, the district court granted our motion to dismiss. In June 2021, the U.S\\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the judgment. On October 3, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the judgment in this action, along with a companion case against another company in whic\\nthe U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the scope of protection available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230). We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we ar\\nvigorously defending it. However, changes to the protections available under Section 230 may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversel\\naffect our business.\\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that “tag suggestions\" and other facial recognition features on our products violated the Texas Capture or Use o\\nBiometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in October 2023. We believe thi\\nlawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\\nTable of Contents\\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertai\\nthe precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in th\\nassessment of fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines an\\npenalties.\\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we may in the future be subject t\\nadditional legal proceedings and disputes.\\nItem 4.Mine Safety Disclosures\\nNot applicable.\\nTable of Contents\\nPART II\\nItem 5.Market for Registrant\\'s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\nMarket Information for Common Stock\\nOn June 9, 2022, Meta\\'s Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \\'META\\'.

In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect ou\\nplans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below\\nand elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitle\\n\"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constan\\ncurrency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled \"—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculat\\nrevenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2022 using 2021 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our fre\\ncash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled \"—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may b\\ndifferent from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-yea\\ncomparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provid\\ninvestors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of busines\\nperformance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results\\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. In 2022, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products t\\nconnect with consumers and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to invest in both our family of apps and our metaverse efforts based on our company priorities.\\nOur financial results and key community metrics for 2022 are set forth below. Our total revenue for 2022 was $116.61 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to 2021, which reflects a $5.96 billion negative impac\\nfrom the appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. Revenue on a constant currency basis was $122.57 billion for 2022, an increase of 4% compared to 2021. Our advertising revenue wa\\nimpacted by a reduction in advertising demand during 2022 compared to 2021, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer spending as a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment, a\\nwell as limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment. Our average price per ad decreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022, partially offset by an 18%\\nyear-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps.\\nIncome from operations for 2022 was $28.94 billion, a decrease of $17.81 billion, or 38%, compared to 2021, mainly due to an increase in payroll and related expenses associated with a 20% increase in employe\\nheadcount particularly in engineering and other technical functions and higher operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure. Starting in the third quarter of 2022, we began a series of cos\\nmanagement initiatives including facilities consolidation, a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees, and a pivot in our data center strategy, which resulted in total restructuring charges of $4.61 billion in 2022. W\\nexpect we may incur significant additional restructuring charges as we continue to focus on cost efficiency measures through 2023.\\nTable of Contents\\nConsolidated and Segment Results\\nWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

This includes a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abando\\nseveral office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 of our employees across the FoA and RL segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation o\\nmultiple data center projects.\\nA summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):\\nFacilities ConsolidationSeverance and Other Personnel\\nCosts Data Center Assets Total\\nCost of revenue $ 154 $ — $ 1,341 $ 1,495\\nResearch and development 1,311 408 — 1,719\\nMarketing and sales 404 234 — 638\\nGeneral and administrative 426 333 — 759\\nTotal $ 2,295 $ 975 $ 1,341 $ 4,611\\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $4.10 billion and RL segment were $515 million.

The impact of severance and other personnel costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 was not material after offsetting with the savings from the decreases in payroll, bonus and other benefit\\nexpenses.\\nSee Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additiona\\ninformation regarding restructuring charges.\\nTable of Contents\\nFamily of Apps Metrics\\n•Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.96 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 5% year-over-year.\\n•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.74 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\\n•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.00 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\\n•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.96 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 2% year-over-year.\\n•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 18% year-over-year in 2022, and the average price per ad decreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022.\\nDevelopments in Advertising\\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites an\\nservices that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a resul\\nof limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.\\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, ePrivacy Directive, and California Privacy Rights Act have impacted our ability to use data signals in our a\\nproducts, and we expect these and other developments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to ou\\nproducts and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented produc\\nchanges and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes t\\nits products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers\\' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and w\\nexpect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\\nTo mitigate these developments, we are working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads an\\nmeasurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enabl\\nmarketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepar\\ncampaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificia\\nintelligence and machine learning to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the privat\\nand secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversel\\nimpact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. I\\nparticular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. In addition, competitiv\\nproducts and services have reduced some users\\' engagement with our products and services. In response to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels and are investing in our artificia\\nintelligence-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it is not currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. W\\nalso have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricte\\nin Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which adversely affected user growth and engagement in 2022. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in 2022, and we expec\\nwill continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.\\nTable of Contents\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted our business and results of operations, with a varied impact on user growth and engagement, as well as the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period\\nWhile we experienced a reduction in advertising demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we believe the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of onlin\\ncommerce, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend. More recently, we believe this growth has declined, and we saw continued softening of advertising demand in 2022 as man\\nactivities that shifted online during COVID-19 related lockdowns resumed in person. We may experience similar volatility in the demand for and pricing of our advertising services as a result of the pandemic in th\\nfuture.\\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessment\\ninvolve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, i\\nis difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the period\\npresented.\\nInvestment Philosophy\\nIn 2022, we continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security\\n(ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people\\'s lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rel\\non our services to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we\\'re doing and the role our services play in the world.\\nWe anticipate that investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and headcount will continue to drive expense growth in 2023, which will adversely affect our operating margin an\\nprofitability. The majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2022, 82% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 18% were recognized in RL. Our FoA\\ninvestments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in ou\\nmetaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments includ\\nexpenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse tha\\nare not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue t\\noperate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, an\\nlong-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising\\nhardware, and digital goods.\\nTable of Contents\\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively\\nbased on their other activities on our Family products.\\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses an\\ncapital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.\\n•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at leas\\none of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multipl\\nproducts in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, an\\nmachine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and acros\\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed base\\non internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP\\nas measures of engagement across our products.

We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter.

We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger applicatio\\n(and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.\\n \\n \\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 2.96 billion MAUs, an increase of 2% from December 31, 2021. Users in India, Nigeria, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in 2022, relative to the\\nsame period in 2021.\\nTable of Contents\\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\\nWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. W\\ndefine ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all source\\nof revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Faceboo\\nor Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See \"Average Revenue Per Perso\\n(ARPP)\" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographie\\nat different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. Fo\\nexample, ARPU in 2022 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.\\nA R P U : $ 1 0 . 1 4 \\xa0 $ 9 . 2 7 \\xa0 $ 1 0 . 1 2 \\xa0 $ 1 0 . 0 0 $ 1 1 . 5 7 $ 9 . 5 4 $ 9 . 8 2 $ 9 . 4 1 $ 1 0 . 8 6\\nA R P U : $ 5 3 . 5 6 \\xa0 $ 4 8 . 0 3 \\xa0 $ 5 3 . 0 1 \\xa0 $ 5 2 . 3 4 \\xa0 $ 6 0 . 5 7 \\xa0 $ 4 8 . 2 9 $ 5 0 . 2 5 $ 4 9 . 1 3 $ 5 8 . 7 7 A R P U : $ 1 6 . 8 7 $ 1 5 . 4 9 $ 1 7 . 2 3 $ 1 6 . 5 0 $ 1 9 . 6 8 $ 1 5 . 3 5 $ 1 5 . 6 4 $ 1 4 . 2 3 $ 1 7 . 2 9\\n \\nA R P U : $ 4 . 0 5 $ 3 . 9 4 $ 4 . 1 6 $ 4 . 3 0 $ 4 . 8 9 $ 4 . 4 7 $ 4 . 5 4 $ 4 . 4 2 $ 4 . 6 1 A R P U : $ 2 . 7 7 $ 2 . 6 4 $ 3 . 0 5 $ 3 . 1 4 $ 3 . 4 3 $ 3 . 1 4 $ 3 . 3 5 $ 3 . 2 1 $ 3 . 5 2\\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various othe\\nsources.\\nTable of Contents\\nOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated b\\ngeography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers.\\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2022, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $39.63, a decrease of 3% from 2021. For 2022, ARPU decreased by 9% in Europe and 4% in Unite\\nStates & Canada, and increased by 4% in Asia-Pacific and 8% in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect tha\\nuser growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may decrease at a higher rate, or increase at a slower rate, relative to ARPU in an\\ngeographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.\\nTable of Contents\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect th\\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various othe\\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or th\\nsusceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. ne\\nin revenue recognition, valuation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and thei\\nassociated estimated useful lives, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Fo\\nfurther information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8\\n\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue o\\na net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible fo\\nfulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on th\\nconsolidated statements of income.\\nValuation of Non-marketable Equity Securities\\nFor our non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issue\\nis similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights an\\npreferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets\\nIn addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions tak\\nplace. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For non-marketable equity securities, we perform a qualitativ\\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee\\'s financial condition and busines\\noutlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators o\\nimpairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if th\\nestimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies\\namong others.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities\\nincluding evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merit\\nof the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate\\nTable of Contents\\narms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating th\\nnature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide n\\nassurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change\\nsuch as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for incom\\ntaxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims fo\\nsubstantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations i\\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to compl\\nwith such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liabilit\\nwhen we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of los\\ncan be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We mak\\nadjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, an\\nupdated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserte\\nmatters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where w\\noperate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount t\\nif successfully asserted against us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulator\\nbodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to ou\\ncontingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters.\\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain\\nTherefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\\'s estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting perio\\nin which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 16 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to ou\\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional informatio\\nregarding these contingencies.\\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated Useful Lives\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchas\\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management t\\nmake significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and futur\\nexpected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade\\nTable of Contents\\nnames from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management\\'s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain an\\nunpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible asset\\nare amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, w\\nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below it\\ncarrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets ma\\nnot be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured b\\na comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property an\\nequipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewe\\nfor the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in futur\\ncircumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remainin\\ncarrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised remaining useful life.\\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the estimated average useful lives of our servers and network assets category effective the second an\\nthe fourth quarters of 2022. The financial impact of the changes in estimates was a reduction in depreciation expense of $860 million and an increase in net income of $693 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the yea\\nended December 31, 2022. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing as of the effective date of the change and applying the revised useful live\\nprospectively.\\nSee Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of thi\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.\\nTable of Contents\\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nRevenue\\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobil\\napplications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks\\ntaken by users.\\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. W\\nrecognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue t\\nevolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. In particular, the number of ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are not currently monetized at the same rate a\\nour feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as tota\\nadvertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenu\\narrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.\\nReality Labs (RL)\\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content.\\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technica\\ninfrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams\\nand energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions\\nand content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments.\\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on ou\\nengineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, RL technology development costs, and professional services.\\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mostly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employee\\nengaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support ou\\ncommunity and product operations.\\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our lega\\nfinance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and relate\\nmatters, as well as other legal fees; professional services, and other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies.\\nTable of Contents\\nResults of Operations\\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2021 compared t\\nthe year ended December 31, 2020, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ende\\nDecember 31, 2021.\\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2021 2020\\nRevenue $ 116,609 $ 117,929 $ 85,965\\nCosts and expenses:\\nCost of revenue 25,249 22,649 16,692\\nResearch and development 35,338 24,655 18,447\\nMarketing and sales 15,262 14,043 11,591\\nGeneral and administrative 11,816 9,829 6,564\\nTotal costs and expenses 87,665 71,176 53,294\\nIncome from operations 28,944 46,753 32,671\\nInterest and other income (expense), net (125) 531 509\\nIncome before provision for income taxes 28,819 47,284 33,180\\nProvision for income taxes 5,619 7,914 4,034\\nNet income $ 23,200 $ 39,370 $ 29,146\\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2021 2020\\nRevenue 100 % 100 % 100 %\\nCosts and expenses:\\nCost of revenue 22 19 19 \\nResearch and development 30 21 21 \\nMarketing and sales 13 12 13 \\nGeneral and administrative 10 8 8 \\nTotal costs and expenses 75 60 62 \\nIncome from operations 25 40 38 \\nInterest and other income (expense), net — — 1 \\nIncome before provision for income taxes 25 40 39 \\nProvision for income taxes 5 7 5 \\nNet income 20 % 33 % 34 %\\n_________________________\\n(1) Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may dif fer from unrounded results.\\nTable of Contents\\nRevenue\\nThe following table sets forth our revenue by source and by segment.

The decrease was mostly driven by advertising revenue.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising revenue in 2022 decreased $1.29 billion, or 1%, compared to 2021 due to a decrease in the average price per ad, partially offset by an increase in the number of ads delivered. In 2022, the averag\\nprice per ad decreased by 16%, as compared with an increase of 24% in 2021. The decrease in average price per ad was driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in product\\nsuch as video and Reels that monetize at lower rates, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In addition, the decrease in average price per ad was impacted by a reduction in advertising demand, which we believ\\nwas primarily driven by reduced marketer spending as a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment and limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and th\\nregulatory environment, as well as, to a lesser extent, the other factors discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results.\" In 2022, the number of ads delivered increased by 18%, a\\ncompared with a 10% increase in 2021. Ads impressions grew in all regions during 2022, mostly driven by an increase in ads delivered in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in the ads delivered during 202\\nwas driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the numbe\\nof ads delivered.\\nReality Labs\\nRL revenue in 2022 decreased $115 million, or 5%, compared to 2021. The decrease in RL revenue was driven by a decrease in the volume of Meta Quest sales.\\nRevenue Seasonality and Customer Concentration\\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sale\\naffects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenu\\nincreased 16%, 16%, and 31% between the third and fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020 declined 17%, 7%, and 16% compared to th\\nfourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue fo\\nthe full year 2022 using the prior\\nTable of Contents\\nyear\\'s monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $122.57 billion and $119.54 billion, respectively. Using thes\\nconstant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $5.96 billion and $5.90 billion higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2022. Using the same constan\\nrates, full year 2022 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $4.64 billion and $4.60 billion, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2021.\\nCost of revenue\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 % change 2021 vs 2020 % change\\n(in millions, except percentages)\\nCost of revenue $ 25,249 $ 22,649 $ 16,692 11 % 36 %\\nPercentage of revenue 22 % 19 % 19 %\\nCost of revenue in 2022 increased $2.60 billion, or 11%, compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, adjusted fo\\na decrease in the depreciation growth rate due to extensions in the useful lives of servers and network assets. In addition, we recorded $1.34 billion of abandonment charges related to data center assets. These increase\\nwere partially offset by a decrease in RL inventory cost including lower losses on purchase commitments.\\nSee Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementar\\nData\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful life of our servers and network assets as well as the abandonment charges related to data center assets\\nrespectively.\\nResearch and development\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 % change 2021 vs 2020 % change\\n(in millions, except percentages)\\nResearch and development $ 35,338 $ 24,655 $ 18,447 43 % 34 %\\nPercentage of revenue 30 % 21 % 21 %\\nResearch and development expenses in 2022 increased $10.68 billion, or 43%, compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher payroll and related expenses and $1.31 billion impairment charges t\\nleases and leasehold improvements as part of our restructuring efforts. Our payroll and related expenses increased as a result of a 26% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 i\\nengineering and other technical functions supporting our continued investment in our family of products and RL.\\nMarketing and sales\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 % change 2021 vs 2020 % change\\n(in millions, except percentages)\\nMarketing and sales $ 15,262 $ 14,043 $ 11,591 9 % 21 %\\nPercentage of revenue 13 % 12 % 13 %\\nMarketing and sales expenses in 2022 increased $1.22 billion, or 9%, compared to 2021.

The decrease was mostly due to a decrease in other income (expense), net related to higher unrealized losse\\nrecognized for our equity investments and an increase in interest expense recognized on long-term debt.\\nProvision for income taxes\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021 % change 2021 vs 2020 % change\\n(in millions, except percentages)\\nProvision for income taxes $ 5,619 $ 7,914 $ 4,034 (29)% 96 %\\nEffective tax rate 19.5 % 16.7 % 12.2 %\\nOur provision for income taxes in 2022 decreased $2.29 billion, or 29%, compared to 2021, mostly due to a decrease in income from operations.\\nOur effective tax rate in 2022 increased compared to 2021, mainly due to an increase in tax shortfalls recognized from share-based compensation and the effect of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of th\\nTreasury in 2022 on foreign tax credits, partially offset by an increase in tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income.\\nEffective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derive\\nintangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in ou\\nbusiness, and the effects of changes in tax law.\\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return\\nwhich depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 27, 2023 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate fo\\nthe full year 2023 to be in the low twenties. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2022, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job\\nAct (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2022 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. I\\nthe mandatory capitalization requirement is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2023 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.\\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision fo\\nincome taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of th\\nintellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.\\nOn August 16, 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The key tax provisions applicable to us are a 15% corporate minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchase\\neffective January 1, 2023. We do\\nTable of Contents\\nnot expect these tax law changes to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position; however, we will continue to evaluate their impact as further information becomes available.\\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2022, we had net uncertain tax positions of $5.49 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued fo\\nuncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties regarding the utilization of ou\\nresearch tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigatio\\ndescribed below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months.\\nSee Note 16 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additiona\\ninformation regarding income tax contingencies.\\nTable of Contents\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash o\\ndeposit with banks, investments in money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketabl\\nsecurities were $40.74 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.26 billion from December 31, 2021. The majority of the decrease was due to $32.04 billion for capital expenditures, including principa\\npayments on finance leases, $27.96 billion repurchases of our Class A common stock, $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, and $1.31 billion fo\\nacquisitions of businesses and intangible assets. These decreases were partially offset by $50.48 billion of cash generated from operations and $9.92 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior note\\n(the \"Notes\") in August 2022.\\nCash paid for income taxes was $6.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $196 million and our federal tax credi\\ncarryforward was $276 million. We anticipate the utilization of most of these net operating losses and credits within the next two years.\\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2022, we repurchased an\\nsubsequently retired 161 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $27.93 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $10.87 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In Januar\\n2023, an additional $40 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.\\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2021 2020\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 50,475 $ 57,683 $ 38,747\\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (28,970)$ (7,570)$ (30,059\\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (22,136)$ (50,728)$ (10,292\\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\\nCash provided by operating activities during 2022 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $11.99 billion of share-based compensation expense, $8.69 billion of depreciatio\\nand amortization, and $3.56 billion of impairment for leases, leasehold improvements, and abandonment charges for data center assets related to our restructuring efforts. The decrease in cash flows from operatin\\nactivities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mainly due to a decrease in net income as adjusted for the aforementioned non-cash items, partially offset by changes in working capital.\\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash used in investing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $31.19 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, partiall\\noffset by $3.53 billion proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mostly due to an increase in net purchase\\nof property and equipment, and a decrease in proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities.\\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $33 billion in 2023.\\nCash Used in Financing Activities\\nCash used in financing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $27.96 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partiall\\noffset by $9.92 billion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stoc\\nand proceeds from the issuance of the Notes.\\nTable of Contents\\nFree Cash Flow\\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate ou\\nperformance, and allocate resources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.\\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to th\\nproperty and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF i\\ndiscussions with our senior management and board of directors.\\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is no\\nintended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\\n• FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\\n• other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, an\\nreconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2021 2020\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 50,475 $ 57,683 $ 38,747\\nPurchases of property and equipment, net (31,186) (18,567) (15,115\\nPrincipal payments on finance leases (850) (677) (604\\nFree Cash Flow $ 18,439 $ 38,439 $ 23,028\\nMaterial Cash Requirements\\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least th\\nnext 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\\nLeases and Contractual Commitments\\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include, among others, offices, data centers, colocations, and land. Our finance lease obligations mostly include certain network infrastructure. Our restructuring efforts t\\nsublease, early terminate or abandon several office buildings under operating leases did not materially change our operating lease obligations.\\nOur contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs.\\nTable of Contents\\nLong-term Debt\\nIn August 2022, we issued an aggregate of $10.0 billion principal amount of the Notes. The Notes were issued in four series, which mature from 2027 through 2062. Short-term and long-term future interes\\npayments obligations as of December 31, 2022 are $411 million and $7.69 billion, respectively. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limite\\nto, capital expenditures, repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.\\nTaxes\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had taxes payable of $1.51 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, of which $361 million is due within one year. As permitted by th\\nTax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include $5.49 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. Due to uncertaintie\\nin the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.\\nContingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, an\\nthat the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanyin\\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subjec\\nto significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financia\\nposition, and cash flows.\\nSee Note 9 — Leases, Note 11 — Long-term Debt, Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, an\\n\"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding leases and contractual commitments, long-term debt, taxes, and contingencies.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II\\nItem 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTable of Contents\\nItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity price risk.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular \\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis o\\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated i\\ncurrencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attemp\\nto hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $81 million, $140 million, an\\n$129 million were recognized in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.\\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, an\\ninvestment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned o\\nour cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $558 million an\\n$714 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes an\\nfrom the current unrealized losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we also had $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes (the \"Notes\") outstanding. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cos\\nfluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods o\\ndeclining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\\nEquity Price Risk\\nOur equity investments are substantially all in non-marketable equity securities and are subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account for most of our non-marketable equity securities using th\\nmeasurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitativ\\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee\\'s financial condition and busines\\noutlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to th\\nlack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the valuation of these companies we invest in and, therefore\\nresult in a material impairment or downward adjustment in our investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $6.20 billion and $6.78 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\\nrespectively.\\nTable of Contents\\nFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities, Note 7 — Fair Value Measurements, and Note 11 — Long-term Debt in th\\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Result\\nof Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTable of Contents\\nItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\\n \\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n \\nPage\\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. 42) 81\\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 85\\nConsolidated Statements of Income 86\\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 87\\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\\' Equity 88\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 89\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 91\\n \\nTable of Contents\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income\\nstockholders\\' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, th\\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the thre\\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022\\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 1, 2023\\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchang\\nCommission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free o\\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performin\\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accountin\\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversigh\\nCommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audi\\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critica\\naudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\nTable of Contents\\nLoss Contingencies\\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory or government inquiries and\\ninvestigations. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company believes it is reasonably\\npossible that it will incur a loss in some of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When applicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss or range o\\npossible loss that may be incurred. However, for certain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of such losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably\\nestimated at this time.\\nAuditing the Company\\'s accounting for, and disclosure of, these loss contingencies was especially challenging due to the significant judgment required to evaluate management\\'\\nassessments of the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential amount or range of such losses.\\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our\\nAuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of these matters, including control\\nrelating to the Company\\'s assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized and their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of possible losses.\\nTo test the Company\\'s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and the conclusion and disclosure regarding any range o\\npossible losses, including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of th\\nboard of directors, read the proceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and investigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate, requested and received\\ninternal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, met with internal and external legal counsel to discuss the nature of the various matters, and obtained representations from\\nmanagement. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\\nTable of Contents\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to transfer pricing\\nagreements with the Company\\'s foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The IRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years subsequent to those examined\\nIf the IRS prevails in its position, it could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus interest and any penalties asserted. The Company uses judgment to (1) determine whethe\\na tax position\\'s technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\\nAuditing the Company\\'s accounting for, and disclosure of, these uncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the significant judgment required to asses\\nmanagement\\'s evaluation of technical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our\\nAuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company\\'s process to assess the technical merits of tax position\\nrelated to these transfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax positions.\\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company\\'s accounting for these positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with our assessment of the technical merits of th\\nCompany\\'s tax positions. This included assessing the Company\\'s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advic\\nobtained by the Company, and requesting and receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We also used our knowledge of, and experience with, the application o\\ninternational and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company\\'s accounting for those tax positions. We analyzed the Company\\'\\nassumptions and data used to determine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and tested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and calculations. We also\\nevaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in relation to these matters.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company\\'s auditor since 2007.\\nSan Mateo, California\\nFebruary 1, 2023\\nTable of Contents\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsorin\\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financia\\nreporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 an\\n2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders\\' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our repor\\ndated February 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in th\\naccompanying Management\\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are \\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of th\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financia\\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of interna\\ncontrol based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purpose\\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonabl\\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statement\\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; an\\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk tha\\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Mateo, California\\nFebruary 1, 2023\\nTable of Contents\\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\\n(In

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOrganization and Description of Business\\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision o\\nhelping to bring the metaverse to life.\\nWe report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The segment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is ou\\nChief Executive Officer (CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc\\nits subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanyin\\nnotes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historica\\ninformation and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related t\\nrevenue recognition, valuation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, including the ultimate resolution of litigation, regulatory matters, and asserted and unasserted claims, valuation o\\nlong-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, fair valu\\nof financial instruments, and fair value of leases. These estimates are based on management\\'s knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future\\nActual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the estimated average useful lives of a majority of the servers and network assets from four years t\\n4.5 years, effective the second quarter of 2022, and further extended the useful lives to five years effective the fourth quarter of 2022. The changes in estimated useful lives were due to expected longer refresh cycles i\\nour data centers. The financial impact of the changes was a reduction in depreciation expense of $860 million and an increase in net income of $693 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31\\n2022. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing as of the effective dates of the changes and applying the revised estimated useful lives prospectively.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods o\\nservices.\\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\\n•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\\n•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\\n•determination of the transaction price;\\n•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\\nTable of Contents\\n•recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to whic\\nwe have the right to invoice for services performed.\\nRevenue excludes sales and usage-based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass-through agent.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationship\\nwith advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. W\\nrecognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control th\\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from\\narrangements that involve third-party publishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements where we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounte\\nfor as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there wil\\nnot be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\nReality Labs Revenue\\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products i\\ntransferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.\\nOther Revenue\\nOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.\\nCost of Revenue\\nOur cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, suc\\nas depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy an\\nbandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs\\nAdditionally, cost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments.\\nContent Costs\\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when th\\ntitle is accepted and available\\nTable of Contents\\nfor viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reac\\ntechnological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria fo\\ncapitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended.\\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\\nShare-based Compensation\\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company\\'s restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over \\nservice period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities\\nincluding evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax asset\\nand liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets an\\nliabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income ta\\neffects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, includin\\nhistorical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merit\\nof the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain ta\\npositions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believ\\nthat we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We mak\\nadjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the fina\\ntax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact o\\nour financial condition and operating results.\\nTable of Contents\\nAdvertising Expense\\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.65 billion, $2.99 billion, an\\n$2.26 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.\\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting mostly of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketabl\\nsecurities as available-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with an\\nunrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\\' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value ar\\nassessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), ne\\non our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\\' equity. The amounts of credit losse\\nrecorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and include such gains o\\nlosses in interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.\\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, and retention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other curren\\nassets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets based upon the expected duration of the restrictions.\\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities usin\\nthe measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respectiv\\ntransaction dates. The change in carrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically review our non-marketable equity securities fo\\nimpairment. When indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we write down the investment to fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2022, losses resulted from\\nsuch remeasurements were $447 million. Gains and losses recorded in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. For additional information, see Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities.\\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We defin\\nfair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair valu\\nmeasurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements o\\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the followin\\nhierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair valu\\nmeasurement:\\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nTable of Contents\\nLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that ar\\nobservable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\'s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing source\\nand models utilizing observable market inputs. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices fo\\nidentical assets in active markets to estimate their fair value. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported b\\nmarket activity.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes o\\nqualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observabl\\ntransaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for th\\nallowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of ou\\ncustomers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded a\\ngeneral and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowances for accounts receivable were immaterial.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line metho\\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets are described below:\\nProperty and Equipment Useful Life/ Amortization period\\nServers and network assets Four to Five years\\nBuildings 25 to 30 years\\nEquipment and other One to 25 years\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets Three to 20 years\\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. I\\nsuch review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset\\'s fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. During the year ende\\nDecember 31, 2022, we recorded $1.34 billion of abandonment charges for data center construction in progress (CIP) assets under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360 related to our restructuring efforts\\nFor additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.\\nTable of Contents\\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimat\\nof useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use o\\nassets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized ove\\nthe revised estimated useful life. See section \"Use of Estimates\" above for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.\\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support production traffic. Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated\\nConstruction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use.\\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and an\\ngain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\\nLease Obligations\\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, colocations, land, network infrastructure, and other equipment. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine i\\nan arrangement is a lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. W\\ncombine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance\\ninsurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach t\\neffectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.\\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixe\\nlease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we conside\\ncontract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.\\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Ou\\nincremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included i\\nproperty and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the leas\\nterms.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment losses of $2.22 billion in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilitie\\nconsolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. Th\\nassumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect th\\nlevel of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.\\nTable of Contents\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims fo\\nsubstantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations i\\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to compl\\nwith such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liabilit\\nwhen we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of los\\ncan be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We mak\\nadjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, an\\nupdated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserte\\nmatters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where w\\noperate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount t\\nif successfully asserted against us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulator\\nbodies before decisions can be finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect t\\nour contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchas\\nconsideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration t\\nidentifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are no\\namortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwil\\nUpon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For change\\nin reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstance\\nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwil\\nhas been identified.\\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation o\\nthese intangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by \\ncomparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite-live\\nintangible assets is not recoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\\nTable of Contents\\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset i\\nsubsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review\\nthe remaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated usefu\\nlife.\\nForeign Currency\\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets an\\nliabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders\\' equity. As o\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cumulative translation losses, net of tax of $1.86 billion and $677 million, respectively.\\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense)\\nnet on our consolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $81 million, $140 million, and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020\\nrespectively.\\nCredit Risk and Concentration\\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalent\\nconsists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities\\nand investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ende\\nDecember 31, 2022 was not material.\\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated 40%, 41%, and 42% of our revenue for the years ende\\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with the majority of revenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe\\nChina, Brazil, Canada, Australia and Japan.\\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material durin\\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nOn January 1, 2022, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts wit\\nCustomers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standard\\nCodification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nOn July 1, 2022, we early adopted ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASU 2022-03), which clarifie\\nand amends the guidance of measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the equity securities. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impac\\non our consolidated financial statements.\\nOn October 1, 2022, we adopted ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency o\\ngovernment assistance received\\nTable of Contents\\nby most business entities by requiring annual disclosures of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity\\'s financia\\nstatements. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nNote 2. Revenue\\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions). For comparative purposes, amounts for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been recast:\\nYear Ended December 31, \\n2022 2021 2020\\nAdvertising $ 113,642 $ 114,934 $ 84,169\\nOther revenue 808 721 657\\nFamily of Apps 114,450 115,655 84,826\\nReality Labs 2,159 2,274 1,139\\nTotal revenue $ 116,609 $ 117,929 $ 85,965\\nRevenue disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our customers, consists of the following (in millions):\\n Year Ended December 31, \\n 2022 2021 2020\\nUnited States and Canada $ 50,150 $ 51,541 $ 38,433\\nEurope 26,681 29,057 20,349\\nAsia-Pacific 27,760 26,739 19,848\\nRest of World 12,018 10,592 7,335\\nTotal revenue $ 116,609 $ 117,929 $ 85,965\\n_________________________\\n(1) United States revenue was $ 47.20  billion, $ 48.38  billion, and $ 36.25  billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively .\\n(2) Europe includes Russia and Turkey , and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.\\nOur total deferred revenue was $526 million and $596 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we expect $482 million of our deferred revenue to be realized in les\\nthan a year.\\nTable of Contents\\nNote 3. Restructuring\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater cost efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities.\\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2022, as a part of our facilities consolidation strategy, we made a decision to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases to align our rea\\nproperty lease arrangements with our anticipated operating needs. As a result, we recorded impairment charges for the related operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and leasehold improvements.\\nIn November 2022, we announced a layoff of approximately 11,000 of our employees across the FoA and RL segments. As a result, we recorded severance and other personnel related expenses for the impacte\\nemployees.\\nIn December 2022, we reevaluated our data center investment strategy to improve efficiency and further advance our efforts around artificial intelligence. As a result, we decided to pivot several of our data cente\\nbuilding projects to a next generation design while also canceling multiple existing data center projects. This strategy led to abandonment charges of the related data center assets.\\nA summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):\\nFacilities Consolidation Severance and Other Personnel\\nCosts Data Center Assets Total\\nCost of revenue $ 154 $ — $ 1,341 $ 1,495\\nResearch and development 1,311 408 — 1,719\\nMarketing and sales 404 234 — 638\\nGeneral and administrative 426 333 — 759\\nTotal $ 2,295 $ 975 $ 1,341 $ 4,611\\n________________________\\n(1) Facilities consolidation includes impairment char ges and accelerated expenses related to certain operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements.\\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $4.10 billion and RL segment were $515 million.\\nThe following table is a summary of the changes in the severance and other personnel liabilities, included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, related to th\\nworkforce reduction (in millions):\\nBalance as of January 1, 2022 $ —\\nSeverance and other personnel costs 975\\nCash payments during the period (203\\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 772\\n__________________________\\n(1) We expect the remaining severance and termination related liabilities to be substantially paid out in cash during the first half of 2023.\\nTable of Contents\\nNote 4. Earnings per Share\\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the liquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, th\\nundistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS i\\nadjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plan.\\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does no\\nassume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 95 million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of restricted stock units (RSUs) were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation as including them\\nwould have an anti-dilutive effect. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\\n Year Ended December 31,\\n 2022 2021 2020\\n Class\\nAClass\\nBClass\\nAClass\\nBClass\\nAClass\\nB \\nBasic EPS:       \\nNumerator       \\nNet income $ 19,729 $ 3,471 $ 33,328 $ 6,042 $ 24,607 $ 4,539 \\nDenominator       \\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share 2,285 402 2,383 432 2,407 444 \\nBasic EPS $ 8.63 $ 8.63 $ 13.99 $ 13.99 $ 10.22 $ 10.22 \\nDiluted EPS:     \\nNumerator       \\nNet income $ 19,729 $ 3,471 $ 33,328 $ 6,042 $ 24,607 $ 4,539 \\nReallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A common stock 3,471 — 6,042 — 4,539 — \\nReallocation of net income to Class B common stock — (19) — (93) — (58)\\nNet income for diluted EPS $ 23,200 $ 3,452 $ 39,370 $ 5,949 $ 29,146 $ 4,481 \\nDenominator       \\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share 2,285 402 2,383 432 2,407 444 \\nConversion of Class B to Class A common stock 402 — 432 — 444 — \\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs 15 — 44 — 37 — \\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 2,702 402 2,859 432 2,888 444 \\nDiluted EPS $ 8.59 $ 8.59 $ 13.77 $ 13.77 $ 10.09 $ 10.09 \\nTable of Contents\\nNote 5.

Long-term Debt\\nIn August 2022, we issued an aggregate of $10.0 billion principal amount of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four series (the “Original Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers and certai\\nnon-U.S. persons. The proceeds from this offering, net of discounts and debt issuance costs, was $9.92 billion. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, bu\\nare not limited to, capital expenditures, repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.

The Exchange Offer expired on December 28, 2022 and settled on December 29, 2022. We did not receive any proceeds from the Exchang\\nOffer, and the aggregate principal amount of the Exchange Notes that were issued was equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Original Notes that were surrendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Each series o\\nthe Exchange Notes is part of the same series of the applicable series of the Original Notes and the terms of the Exchange Notes offered in the Exchange Offer are substantially identical to the terms of the respectiv\\nseries of the Original Notes, except that the Exchange Notes are registered under the Securities Act, and certain transfer restrictions, registration rights, and additional interest provisions relating to the Original Notes d\\nnot apply to the Exchange Notes.

Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United State\\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. Thes\\ntwo actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user dat\\npractices. On September 25, 2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed i\\nthe consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complain\\nwas filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs file\\na notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. With respect to the multiple putative class actions filed against us beginning o\\nMarch 20, 2018 alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States wer\\nconsolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action\\nOn December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us and is subject to court approval. In addition, our platform and user dat\\npractices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the Unite\\nStates, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required u\\nto pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remai\\nongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historica\\nplatform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach o\\nfiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a secon\\namended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches an\\nprivacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, we are currently subject to an IDPC\\ninquiry regarding Meta Platforms Ireland\\'s ability to transfer European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data to the United States, which is described further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I\\nItem 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of th\\nGDPR\\'s consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount o\\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to thes\\ninquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material in the aggregate.\\nTable of Contents\\nBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal and California state courts alleging that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\\nin teenage users, resulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class action alleging similar harms was also filed in California state court on behalf of users under the age of 13 and three school district\\nrecently filed public nuisance claims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The state court proceeding\\nare now pending before a trial judge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. We are also subject to government investigations an\\nrequests from multiple regulators concerning the use of our products, and the related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to governmen\\ninvestigations and requests relating to a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcemen\\npractices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021\\nmultiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws\\nbreach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws i\\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified damages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increase\\ndemand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022\\nthe court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs\\' claims, but permitted its fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs\\' motion for class certification. On June 21, 2022\\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court\\'s class certification order, and the district court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit i\\nwithout merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertai\\nthe precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in th\\nassessment of fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines an\\npenalties.\\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can b\\nreasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With respect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amoun\\nof loss or range of possible loss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in th\\naggregate.\\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we are subject to variou\\nlitigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, amon\\nother things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we wer\\ninformed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that w\\nengaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 an\\nWhatsApp\\nTable of Contents\\nin 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorney\\ngeneral. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that w\\nengaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. Th\\ncomplaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company\\'\\nalleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed b\\nthe FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC\\'s complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general\\'s case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of th\\norder dismissing their case and that appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, w\\nfiled a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC\\'s amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federa\\ncourts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, an\\nseeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. O\\nJanuary 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought o\\nbehalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In addition\\non July 27, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking to preliminarily enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited as an allege\\nviolation of antitrust law. The FTC subsequently filed a related complaint in their administrative court seeking to permanently enjoin the transaction as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and seeking other relie\\nas well. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace t\\nFacebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that “tag suggestions\" and other facial recognition features on our products violated the Texas Capture or Use o\\nBiometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in October 2023. We believe thi\\nlawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.\\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation an\\nenforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims\\nregulatory, tax, or government inquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probabl\\nand the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable rang\\nof possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range o\\nloss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\\'s estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition\\nincluding in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 16 — Income Taxes.\\nIndemnifications\\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmles\\nagainst losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties.\\nTable of Contents\\nThese agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, an\\ncertain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved i\\neach particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2022, there was not \\nreasonable possibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2022.\\nNote 14. Stockholders\\' Equity\\nCommon Stock\\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stoc\\nand 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared b\\nour board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2022, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of each share o\\nClass A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares o\\nour Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are collectively referred to as common stock throughout th\\nnotes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 2,247 million shares of Class A common stock and 367 million shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.\\nShare Repurchase Program\\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, $38.79 billio\\nremained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 161 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $27.93 billion. As o\\nDecember 31, 2022, $10.87 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2023, an additional $40 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.\\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, an\\nshares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act o\\n1934, as amended.\\nShare-based Compensation Plan\\nWe have one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was amended in each of June 2016, February 2018, and December 2022. Our Amende\\n2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, an\\nconsultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 66 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amende\\n2012 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026, by a numbe\\nof shares of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding\\nTable of Contents\\nDecember 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 56 million shares of Class A common stoc\\nreserved for issuance, effective January 1, 2023.\\nIn December 2022, our board of directors approved an amendment to our Amended 2012 Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Amended 2012 Plan by 425 million shares, effectiv\\nMarch 1, 2023 (Plan Amendment). The Plan Amendment was also approved by holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in December 2022.\\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022:\\nNumber of SharesWeighted-Average Grant Date\\nFair Value Per Share\\n(in thousands)\\nUnvested at December 31, 2021 98,848 $ 244.32 \\nGranted 106,693 $ 195.66 \\nVested (54,013)$ 218.24 \\nForfeited (24,418)$ 231.98 \\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 127,110 $ 216.93 \\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $305.40 and $188.73, respectively.

During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on th\\nconsolidated statements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1.07 billion and $960 million, respectively.\\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $10.76 billion as of December 31, 2022 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of $6.49 billion within our provision of income taxe\\nat such time.\\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland\\nWe are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 tax years. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.\\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notic\\napplies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with th\\nposition of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS\\'s amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is highe\\nthan the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Base\\non the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion i\\nexcess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years an\\nalso proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in a\\nadditional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS i\\nthe second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from th\\npositions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would ow\\nwould be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2022, we have not resolve\\nthese matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. Th\\ntiming of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Give\\nthe number of years remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax authorities prevail in th\\nassessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\nTable of Contents\\nNote 17. Segment and Geographical Information\\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp\\nand other services. RL includes augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. Our operating segments are the same as our reportable segments.\\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker (CODM), who allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment\\'\\nrevenue and income (loss) from operations. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.\\nRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include certain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with partnershi\\narrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to th\\nperformance measures of the operating segments. Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure. Indirec\\noperating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security expenses, are mostly allocated based on headcount.\\nThe following table sets forth our segment information of revenue and income (loss) from operations (in millions). For comparative purposes, amounts for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been recast:\\n Year Ended December 31, \\n 2022 2021 2020\\nRevenue:\\nFamily of Apps $ 114,450 $ 115,655 $ 84,826\\nReality Labs 2,159 2,274 1,139\\nTotal revenue $ 116,609 $ 117,929 $ 85,965\\nIncome (loss) from operations:\\nFamily of Apps $ 42,661 $ 56,946 $ 39,294\\nReality Labs (13,717) (10,193) (6,623\\nTotal income from operations $ 28,944 $ 46,753 $ 32,671\\nFor information regarding revenue disaggregated by geography, see Note 2 — Revenue.\\nThe following table sets forth our long-lived assets by geographic area, which consist of property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets (in millions):\\n December 31,\\n 2022 2021\\nUnited States $ 76,334 $ 55,497\\nRest of the world 15,857 14,467\\nTotal long-lived assets $ 92,191 $ 69,964\\n_________________________\\n(1) No individual country , other than disclosed above, exceeded 10% of our total long-lived assets for any period presented.\\nTable of Contents\\nItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\nNone.\\nItem 9A.Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a\\n15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO\\nhave concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required t\\ndisclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission\\nand that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nManagement\\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment o\\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadwa\\nCommission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regardin\\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report wit\\nrespect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management\\'s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2022 tha\\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed an\\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fac\\nthat there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\\nItem 9B.Other Information\\nNone.\\nItem 9C.Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\\nNot Applicable.\\nTable of Contents\\nPART III\\nItem 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\\nThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ende\\nDecember 31, 2022.\\nOur board of directors has adopted a Code of Conduct applicable to all officers, directors, and employees, which is available on our website (investor.fb.com) under \"Leadership & Governance.\" We intend t\\nsatisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of our Code of Conduct by posting such information on the website address and location specifie\\nabove.\\nItem 11.Executive Compensation\\nThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ende\\nDecember 31, 2022.\\nItem 12.Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\\nThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ende\\nDecember 31, 2022.\\nItem 13.Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\\nThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ende\\nDecember 31, 2022.\\nItem 14.Principal Accountant Fees and Services\\nThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ende\\nDecember 31, 2022.\\nTable of Contents\\nPART IV\\nItem 15.
